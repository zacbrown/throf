# Throf

## Introduction
A simple concatenative programming language influenced by Forth, Factor, and PostScript. Syntactically, Throf most closely resembles Factor and in fact, many simple Factor scripts are valid in Throf.

More interesting features, not yet implemented, will steal from ideas in PostScript and Forth most likely. Throf is growing, organically and without any real sense of direction. It is a "forever project."

## Basic Requirements
Throf is being built with Visual Studio 2012's MSVC. It takes advantage of many C++11 features, including:

* lambdas
* unordered_set
* unordered_map
* auto

Additionally, Throf will compile with GCC 4.7.2 and above.
